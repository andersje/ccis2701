<p>Several tables have been added to your database.  You can learn about them using the DESC command.  They are named book, author, publisher and book_author.</p>
<p>I recommend using the tee command to record your work as you determine the correct answer for each of the following questions.  Be sure to use a text-editor of some sort to trim down the file, to save the instructor some effort when reading your answer file.  Name your answer file 'lab3.answers'</p>
<ol>
<li>(2 points) show a listing of all authors in the author table, and the book_id of the books they have written.  You will have to join the author table to the book_author table.</li>
<li>(4 points) Alter the answer to the above question so that the title and ISBN of each book are shown in addition to the author's first and last name</li>
<li>(4 points) JOIN the book and publisher tables such that all book titles are shown as well as publisher name.</li>
<li>(6 points) JOIN the book and publisher tables such that only publishers WITHOUT any book entries are shown.</li>
<li>(4 points) display all book titles, along with author's full name, publisher's name and zip code, and the book's ISBN.</li>
<li>(1 points) sort the answer to the previous question by the book title</li>
<li>(1 points) sort the answer to the previous question by the author's last name</li>
<li>(1 points) sort the answer to the previous question by the publisher's name</li>
<li>(2 points) Show all authors from the author table, along with a count of all the books they have written</li>
