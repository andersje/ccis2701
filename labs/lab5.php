<ol>
<li>(25 points) Install MySQL on your PC.  You can install it under windows, linux or MacOS.  Once this is done, create three new users:  larry, curly and moe.<br />  Grant them permissions such that they can do the following things:  moe should be able to do anything at all.  Curly should only be able to use the SELECT command.  Larry should be able to use SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DROP.  Each should have their passwords set to 'stooge'.  Send an email to the instructor listing the set of commands necessary to actually accomplish these tasks.</li>
